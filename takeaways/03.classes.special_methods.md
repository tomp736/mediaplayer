## Special Methods 

### __repr__

__repr__ is a special method in Python used to define the "representation" of an object. It is used to specify the string representation of an object that will be used for debugging purposes, and is also used by the repr function.

``` python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyClass({self.value})"
```
The __repr__ method should return a string that, if evaled, would create an object equivalent to the original. For example, repr(MyClass(42)) would return "MyClass(42)".
