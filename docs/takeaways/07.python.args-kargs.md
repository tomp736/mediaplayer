# Python - *args , **kwargs

- Central to python because it allows you to have flexible function signatures. 
- In python you can only have one `__init__` definition for a class.


`*args` allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function, which will be collected into a tuple. 

`**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function, which will be collected into a dictionary. 

``` py
# Example from ChatGPT
def my_function(*args, **kwargs):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f'{key}: {value}')

my_function(1, 2, 3, a=4, b=5, c=6)
# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# a: 4
# b: 5
# c: 6
```
