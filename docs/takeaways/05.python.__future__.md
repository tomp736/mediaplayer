## Typing

[PEP 563](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/)

``` python
from __future__ import annotations
```
- defined variable annotations, explicitly tying them with the type hinting use case.
- meant to solve the problem of forward references in type annotations


[PEP 649](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/)
- It solves the same circular reference problems solved by PEP 563, while otherwise preserving Pythonâ€™s original annotation semantics, including allowing annotations to refer to local and class variables.
